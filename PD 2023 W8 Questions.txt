2023: Week 8 - Taking Stock
February 22, 2023
 Created by: Carl Allchin

For the final week of Intermediate Month, our data set needs so cleaning and grouping to allow us to analyse the top trades from The Data Source Bank's trading floor. 

No Wolf on Wall Street moments have happened but we've had some big trades happen across a wide range of companies so we need to understand these more. Can you help us find the top 5 trades for a series of different ways we look at the companies traded and the prices of the trades?

Input
There are 12 files to input this week. Each number in the file name reflects the month it came from (January's file doesn't have a value)
