2023: Week 3 - Targets for DSB
January 18, 2023
 Challenge by: Jenny Martin

For the third week of beginner month, we're going to be building on the skills that we've already learnt, as well as exploring new concepts. This week may feel a little more challenging, but I promise you're ready for it!

Data Source Bank has some quarterly targets for the value of transactions that are being performed in-person and online. It's our job to compare the transactions to these target figures.

Inputs
The same transactions file as the first week's 

Quarterly Targets dataset 

Requirements
Input the data
For the transactions file:
Filter the transactions to just look at DSB (help)
These will be transactions that contain DSB in the Transaction Code field
Rename the values in the Online or In-person field, Online of the 1 values and In-Person for the 2 values
Change the date to be the quarter (help)
Sum the transaction values for each quarter and for each Type of Transaction (Online or In-Person) (help)
For the targets file:
Pivot the quarterly targets so we have a row for each Type of Transaction and each Quarter (help)
 Rename the fields
Remove the 'Q' from the quarter field and make the data type numeric (help)
Join the two datasets together (help)
You may need more than one join clause!
Remove unnecessary fields
Calculate the Variance to Target for each row (help)
Output the data
