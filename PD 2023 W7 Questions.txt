February 15, 2023
Challenge by: Jenny Martin

As in many organisations, sometimes the answer to a question can only be found by combining multiple datasets together. Data Source Bank are looking to find transactions which may possibly be fraudulent. They define potentially fraudulent transactions as:

Being more than £1,000 in value
Excluding cancelled transactions
Platinum Bank Accounts have different rules for identifying fraudulent transactions so we will exclude them from our analysis
What the fraud team need is the ability to make phone calls to customers to double check whether these transactions are genuine.
Inputs
The data is spread across 4 different tables. We've provided an extract for each of these. 
Transaction Path 


Transaction Detail

Make sure field naming convention matches the other tables

Ensure there is one row per Account Holder ID
Joint accounts will have 2 Account Holders, we want a row for each of them
For the Account Holders table:
Make sure the phone numbers start with 07
