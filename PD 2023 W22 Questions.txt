Challenge by: Tanbir Jalil

This is our next challenge from one of the members of the 38th cohort of the Data School UK.

You have been hired to create a dataset for the Prep School that will allow them to analyse the correlation between attendance and test scores.

Inputs

Requirements
Input the data
First we must join the test score data set and the additional class attendance data set 
Clean Data: there’s a few spelling mistakes in the data set, use the data tool of your choice to correct these mistakes before we proceed. These mistakes are in the “Subject”  Column
Use a calculated field to clean up the test score column, so each number is a rounded to the nearest whole number
Split the student name column so we can see the first name and surname in two separate columns, named appropriately
If any student has an attendance percentage less than 70%, flag it as "Low Attendance" in a new column "attendance flag". Conversely, if above 90%, flag as “high attendance”. And anything else as “Medium”.  
Output the data
