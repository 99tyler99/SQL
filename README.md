2023: Week 23 - Is it the teacher or the student? Part I
June 07, 2023
Challenge by: Andreea Scintei

This is our next challenge from one of the members of the 38th cohort of the Data School UK.

This week the Prep School has decided to evaluate the quality of their teaching. As this is not an easy task they are trying to tackle it from different points of view. They have a team conducting surveys and one analysing student performance over the past year. 

As part of the analytics team, you have been tasked with identifying which classes struggle the most with each course so that the school can provide targeted support or adapt their approach to the curriculum.
